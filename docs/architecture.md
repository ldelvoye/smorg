# Architecture (Written by John Clanker)

smorg is a keyboard-driven terminal dashboard: each connected integration is a
tab, nothing is enabled by default, and the app is read-plus-safe-actions by
default — it shows what's on your plate and opens things. Writes to a service
are exceptional: today only Spotify's play/queue actions (`ActionClass.REMOTE`)
mutate remote state, via a shell-mediated credential worker that keeps panels
off the network. A general restricted-write permission model is still ahead.

This document explains the load-bearing decisions. How to *add* an integration
is covered in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Three layers, two seams

```

- **Integrations** own everything service-specific: fetching, parsing,
  pagination, filtering, and how their tab looks.
- **The shell** owns everything that makes the tabs feel like one program: the
  tab bar, the global keymap, the management menu, refresh scheduling, the
  panel states, the detail region, seen-state injection, and shared rendering
  widgets.
- **Core and auth** are the machine: MCP transport, shape validation,
  sanitizers, seen-state storage, config, credentials.

The seams are enforced, not conventional. The shell reaches an integration only
through the `Integration` protocol; errors cross only as `IntegrationError`
subclasses; neither side imports the other — `core/registry.py` is the only
place integration ids appear. Tests grep for violations ("sources never format,
panels never fetch"), so a broken integration's blast radius is its own tab.

## Connecting is two choices, not one

Every integration answers two independent questions, and fusing them is the
easiest way to misread this design:

- **Auth: how credentials are obtained.** A manifest's `AuthPath.method`
  is either an OAuth provider to authorize against (`OAuthMethod`) or a
  token the user creates in the service and pastes in (`TokenMethod`). Neither
  is the default: the path decides the whole connect flow, and nothing
  downstream re-derives which kind it is holding. All of this lives in `auth/`.
- **Transport: what `fetch` talks to once credentials exist.** An MCP session
  (`core/mcp.py`) or the service's plain REST API. Nothing declares this
  anywhere — it is a private choice of the integration's `source.py`.

The current integrations occupy diagonal corners, which makes the two axes
look like one:

|                  | MCP transport | REST transport |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **OAuth**        | Linear        | Spotify        |
| **Pasted token** | —             | GitHub         |

The empty corners are circumstance, not design. Token + MCP would be an MCP
server reached with a static bearer token.

### The auth axis: OAuth where it is cheap, a pasted token where it is not

**OAuth is worth it only where the service makes it cheap.** The OAuth core
does metadata discovery (RFC 8414) and dynamic client registration (RFC 7591):
a provider supporting both (a `DiscoveredProvider`) connects in one browser
round trip with nothing to configure. Today that combination is essentially the
remote-MCP-server auth profile — the real reason MCP appears in this design at
all, and why "OAuth-capable" and "has an MCP endpoint" currently coincide. The
coincidence is not the architecture: nothing in `auth/` knows MCP exists.

A provider offering neither is declared as a `StaticProvider`: the manifest
carries the endpoints, and the user creates the OAuth app themselves and
pastes its client id. That per-user setup step is worth it only when the
provider issues no token a user could paste instead.

GitHub publishes no metadata document and registers no clients, so an OAuth
tab there would need an app somebody registered by hand and a client id
configured before the first login — a setup step per user, to arrive where one
pasted token already arrives.

What a pasted token gives up is renewal: nothing here issued it, so nothing here
can refresh it. A token that expires or is revoked surfaces as `AuthExpired` on
the next fetch, and the tab says to connect again — the same path an
unrefreshable OAuth token already takes, which is why it needed no new machinery.

### The transport axis: MCP data is not a contract

On the data side MCP earns no special standing. Measured directly across four
MCP servers:

| Server | Payload                                      | Pagination                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Linear | strict JSON; a `fields` param picks the keys | `hasNextPage` + cursor                  |
| Sentry | strict JSON                                  | `hasMore` boolean                       |
| Notion | typed JSON, one prose/markup field           | absent, though a sibling tool has it    |
| Slack  | a markdown document inside a JSON string     | a sentence with the cursor in backticks |

Parse cost spans two orders of magnitude, so **no generic adapter can exist** —
a component that turned any MCP server into a tab would have to be a markdown
scraper to handle the worst case. That is why a tab is an integration with its
own source module, and why the allowlist is a feature: when a server changes
its output, exactly one source breaks, its tab shows the failure, and every
other tab keeps working.

Nothing versions MCP tool output, so every source treats response *shape* as
untrusted alongside content: a field that should be an object may be a string,
and that must degrade one tab (`Malformed`), never crash the app. The protocol
revision we speak, and the upgrade path, live in [mcp-protocol.md](mcp-protocol.md).

## Failure semantics

Status is per-tab, never global. A panel has five states — loading, ready,
empty, error, stale — and empty ("nothing assigned to you") must never look
like error ("the service is down"): a dashboard that blurs them can't be
trusted.

Errors are typed by the one question the shell acts on — **could retrying
help?**

- `AuthExpired` — no; offer a re-connect.
- `AccessNotAllowed` — no; the credentials lack permission, and a re-connect
  with the same access would not grant it. Keep last-good data.
- `Unavailable` — yes; keep last-good data, mark it stale ("as of 14:02").
- `Malformed` — no; the tab is broken, say so plainly.

## Refresh follows attention, not a clock

Zero background timers. Refresh happens on `r`, on switching to a stale tab,
and on the terminal regaining focus — nobody needs fresh data for a tab nobody
is looking at. Only the visible tab fetches at startup, so opening the app
costs one request regardless of how many tabs are configured. Re-rendering
(e.g. a countdown) is a separate, local concern from re-fetching.

## Change marks that clear themselves

The signal worth showing is "changed since you last looked", not "unread". Per
item, the store keeps the `updatedAt` seen when you last opened it; the item is
highlighted when it has moved on since. New items have no stored value and start
highlighted; opening (enter or `o`) records the current stamp; `m` clears the
tab. Keying off change rather than a read flag means an untouched backlog does
not stay bold forever.

## Security posture

- **Tokens live in the OS keychain**, and the store refuses any keyring backend
  not on a known-secure allowlist — an unrelated `keyrings.alt` install would
  otherwise silently supply an insecure one. The plaintext file fallback is
  opt-in only (`SMORG_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file`), never automatic.
- **Permissions are reported, not repaired.** A widened config directory or
  credentials file fails loudly; silently re-tightening would erase the
  evidence that tokens had been readable.
- **The OAuth callback binds an ephemeral port** — nothing can squat a port it
  can't predict — and the server-side registration keeps a stable loopback URI
  (RFC 8252 §7.3 lets servers ignore the port, verified live).
- **A pasted token is never echoed.** It is entered through a masked field in
  the app and through `getpass` on the CLI, and a rejected entry is reported
  without repeating what was typed — an error message printed to a terminal is
  exactly where a credential would otherwise end up in scrollback.
- **Server text is sanitized at the source** (control characters stripped,
  length-capped with a visible marker) and rendered without markup
  interpretation, so a hostile issue title can't restyle the UI or emit
  terminal escapes. Links resolve only from structured server data, https only.
- **Tokens never reach integration code paths' output**: errors carry redacted
  representations, and the serialized credential form never leaves the store
  module — a test fails if any other module references it.
